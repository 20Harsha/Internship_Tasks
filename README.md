# The Sparks Foundation Internship tasks
## Task 1 : Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning

1. Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.This is Simple Linear Regression task as it involve only 2 variables.
2. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
3. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
4. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

# Results: 
* The dataset consist of students study hours and their percentage score
*   There are 25 rows and 2 columns.
*   Student's Percentage score range from 17 - 95, where 17 is the minimum score,95 being the maximum score and median score is 47.
*   Student's study hours range from 1.1 hrs - 9.2 hrs where 1.1hrs is the minimum, 9.2 is the maximum and median number of hours students studied is 4.8.
*   Correlation between Hours vs Scores is 0.9761. Hence their is a positive linear relationship between Hours studied and Students percentage score.
*   **Problem Statement :**  Predict score of a student when student studies for 9.5 hrs/day. 
    
    Using simple linear regression to predict student's percentage score. Linear regression model has predicted the percentage score as 96.169 when student studies for 9.5             hrs/day.
*  The Simple Linear Regression model performs well as the R-Squared value is 0.945.

## Task 2 :  Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning

1. Predict the optimum number of clusters from the iris dataset and represent it visually.
2. You can use R or Python to perform this task.

# Results: 
* The dataset consist of Id ,Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length ,Petal width and Species.

* There are 150 rows and 6 columns.

* **Problem Statement** : Predict the optimum number of clusters from the iris dataset and represent it visually.

* From the above plot using elbow method we can see that our elbow point occurs at 3 .So the number of optimum clusters for iris dataset will be 3.

* KMeans is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Using Kmeans the data has been clustered. It divides the data into 3 clusters of flower species they are Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolour and Iris-virginica.
